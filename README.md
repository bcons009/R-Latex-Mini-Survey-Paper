# R-Latex-Mini-Survey-Paper
A group project involving the creation of a "mini survey paper" using the LaTex text editor and generating graphics using the R programming language along with the ggplot2 library. All data visualizations generated using R were created by me.

The completed paper can be read by viewing the `aesthetics_paper.pdf` file.

Each data visualization image file is created by a separate R markdown (.rmd) file:
- `response_rate_comparison.png` is generated by `Response Rates.rmd`
- `response_time_comparison.png` is generated by `Response Times.rmd`
- `response_rate_dimensional_comparison.png` is generated by `2D v 3D Response Rates.rmd`
- `response_time_dimensional_comparison.png` is generated by `2D v 3D Response Times.rmd`

All graphics are based on the data found in the following [research paper](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.208.6756&rep=rep1&type=pdf) by Nick Cawthon and Andrew Vande Moere.
